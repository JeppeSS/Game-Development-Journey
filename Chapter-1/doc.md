## About the Author

### A Software Developer's Passion for Games

I'm not a game developer by trade; I'm a software developer with a deep passion for games. Throughout my career, I've explored various facets of software development, but my fascination with the inner workings of games has always been a driving force. In my spare time, I've embarked on numerous journeys into the realm of game development, ranging from creating simple terminal games to diving into the complexities of 2D and 3D game projects.


### Embracing the Challenge of Completion

While my journey in game development has seen me start and experiment with various projects, I've faced a common challenge: the tendency to jump from one idea to the next without completing them. It's a challenge that many of us in the creative field can relate to. However, I've recognized the importance of commitment and persistance in the pursuit of turning ideas into finished games.

### Sharing the Quest for Completion

This tutorial is a commitment to not only my personal growth but also my dedication to help others who share a similar passion for game development. I want to emphasize that I'm not a game development expert. Instead, I see this journey as an opportunity to learn, grow, and, most importantly, overcome the challenge of sticking with a project to its completion.

### A Journal of Progress

Consider this tutorial as my journal, chronicling my quest to become a better game developer and, most crucially, to finish waht I start. Together, we'll learn from each other's experiences and support one another in our pursuit of creating remarkable games. Join me in embracing the challenge of turning our ideas into fully realized projects, and let's embark on this adventure of creativity and completion together.
