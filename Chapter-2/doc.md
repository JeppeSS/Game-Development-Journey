# Setting up the Toolbox

"You find yourself surrounded by ancient scrolls and flickering torches. How you arrived here is a mystery lost to your memory, yet an undeniable sense of purpose courses through your veins. Before you, a grand, ornate door stands tall, its intricate carvings seeming to whisper secrets of untold adventures.

With cautious determination, you push the door open, and it swings wide, revealing a vast chamber filled with mystical artifacts. In the heart of this chamber, a bright light shimmers with an iridescent glow, beckoning you forward. There's no turning back now; destiny awaits, and you step boldly into the radiance.

As you cross the threshold into the light, you feel a surge of energy, and suddenly, everything goes dark. Time itself appears to stand still, and you find yourself suspended in a void of uncertainty. However, amidst this inky obscurity, the unwavering sense of purpose within you remains unshaken.

In the depths of this enigmatic void, a luminous figure materializes, its form defined by a soft, otherworldly glow. An inexplicable calm washes over you, and any fear you might have felt is replaced by an overwhelming sense of security. It's as though this presence has been with you all along.

Then, a voice begins to speak, its words resonating within the void"


## Choosing a language

Before we dive into the realm of coding, a realm where language is both our guide and our enigma, we must prepare. This tutorial is not bound to a single tongue or tool, but rather, it is a journey through the labyrinthine pathways of your choice. The language you select will be your compass in this uncharted territory, and though the paths may differ, the destination is yours to define.

```
package main

import "core:fmt"

main :: proc() {
    fmt.println("Hello, Odin!")
}
```

Consider this a map to your adventure. The journey we embark upon is a reflection of your curiosity and creativity. You may wonder why I've chosen Odin as my guide - a language born of new beginnings and bound by simplicity. Allow me to share my reasons:

* **Simplicity:** Odin's clean and minimalist syntax is perfect for newcomers, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
* **Perfomance:** Odin boasts impressive performance, which is crucial for game development, where efficiency is paramount.
* **Community:** Although smaller compared to some other languages, the Odin community is tight-knit, helpful, and passionate about the language.
* **Versatility:** Odin is a versatile language, allowing you to create games for various platforms and genres.

However, I encourage you to explore other language like C, C++, C#, Rust, Zig or  Python. Each offers unique strengths and characteristics that can shape your path as a game developer.
