# Setting up the Toolbox

"You find yourself surrounded by ancient scrolls and flickering torches. How you arrived here is a mystery lost to your memory, yet an undeniable sense of purpose courses through your veins. Before you, a grand, ornate door stands tall, its intricate carvings seeming to whisper secrets of untold adventures.

With cautious determination, you push the door open, and it swings wide, revealing a vast chamber filled with mystical artifacts. In the heart of this chamber, a bright light shimmers with an iridescent glow, beckoning you forward. There's no turning back now; destiny awaits, and you step boldly into the radiance.

As you cross the threshold into the light, you feel a surge of energy, and suddenly, everything goes dark. Time itself appears to stand still, and you find yourself suspended in a void of uncertainty. However, amidst this inky obscurity, the unwavering sense of purpose within you remains unshaken.

From the depths of this enigmatic void, a luminous figure materializes, its form defined by a soft, otherworldly glow. An indescribable tranquility washes over you, replacing any vestiges of fear with an overwhelming sense of security. It's as though this presence has accompanied you from the dawn of time.

Then, a voice resonates within the void, its words carrying wisdom from the annals of eternity."

## Choosing a language

Before we plunge into the realm of coding, where language serves as both our guide and our enigma, we must make preparations. This tutorial does not confine you to a single tongue or tool; rather, it invites you on a yourney through the labyrinthine pathways of your choice. The language you select will be your compass in this uncharted territory, and though the paths may vary, the destination is yours to define.

### Installing Odin

To embark on this odyssey with Odin as your guide, you must first install it on your system. Here's how:

1. **Download Odin:** Begin your quest by visiting the [Odin website](https://odin-lang.org/) and locating the download section. Choose the version tailored to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Installation Instructions:** Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system. Odin's installation process is typically straightforward and meticulously documented.

3. **Verification:** Once the installation is complete, you can validate it by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:
    ```shell
    odin version
    ```
    If you see the Odin version displayed, congratulations! You've successfully harnessed the power of Odin!

Now that Odin's essence courses through your system, you're primed to embark on your coding adventure with this formidable language as your companion.

### Setting up Visual Studio Code

To sculpt your code and breathe life into your game development endavors, a trusty text editor is essential. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is an excellent choice. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Download VS Code:** Navigate to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Installation:** Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system. The process is typically straightforward and user friendly.

3. **Extensions:** VS Code's power lies in its extensions. To supercharge your game development experience, consider installing extensions tailored to your needs. Open VS Code, go to the Extensions marketplace (click the square icon on the sidebar), and search for the relevant extension, I can recommend  [Odin Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielGavin.ols).

Now, with Odin installed and VS Code at your fingertips, you possess a formidable arsenal to begin crafting your game development masterpieces.

```
package main

import "core:fmt"

main :: proc() {
    fmt.println("Hello, Odin!")
}
```

This code example marks the first milestone on your quest. It's a simple 'Hello, Odin!' program, your first communication with Odin's magic. As you delve deeper into this journey, you'll uncover why Odin shines as a guide:

* **Simplicity:** Odin's clean and minimalist syntax is an ideal starting point, making it a superb choice for newcomers.
* **Perfomance:** Odin wields impressive power, a crucial asset in the realm of game development, where efficiency reigns supreme.
* **Community:** While its community may be smaller compared to other languages, Odin's supporters are tightly-knit, helpful, and fervent in their devotion.
* **Versatility:** Odin's flexibility extends across platforms and genres, offering a canvas upon which your creativity can flourish.

Yet, your adventure doesn't conclude here. Explore other languages like JavaScript, C++, C#, Rust, Zig or Python, each bearing unique strengths and qualities to shape your path as a game developer.
